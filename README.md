# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz
Homework-4
For this homework, I had to create a multiple choice quiz.
Score had to be recorded.
It had to be timed.
The questions had to be related to Javascript.
When an answer was chosen the next question with its set of answer options had to appear.
When incorrect answers were chosen, time had to be taken way from the clock.
I created variables, buttoms and functions in order to do so.
I created an array of questions and answers in order be placed within a function so that the questions would loop through.
When the correct answer is chosen, an alert stating "Correct" would appear.
The score was the time remaining once the quiz is completed.
INSTRUCTIONS:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
